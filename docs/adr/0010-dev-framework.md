# Express.js for dev Backend

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2020-07-16

## Context and Problem Statement

A prebuilt NodeJS framework should be considered to help create the web application faster and smarter.

## Considered Options

* AdonisJS
* ExpressJS
* MeteorJS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ExpressJS, because it outweighs the other options in terms of consequences and was already used in the Beiboot backend.

### Positive Consequences

* Good, because it's been used before in the Beiboot backend
* Good, because it's a fast, non-opinionated, minimalist web framework
* Good, because it enables building a light-weight application that can process more than a single request seamlessly
* Good, because it offers a robust API
* Good, because it supports a lot of other packages and other templates
* Good, because it's almost the standard for Node.js web middleware

### Negative Consequences

* No new technology to learn
