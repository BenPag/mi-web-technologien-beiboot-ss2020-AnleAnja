# TODO Group Code of Conduct Template + self written additions as Code of Conduct

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2020-05-06

## Context and Problem Statement

To enable a healthy communication between possible different contributors, defining a Code of Conduct with different DOs
and DON'Ts is essential.

## Considered Options

* self written Code of Conduct
* TODO Group: Open Code of Conduct
* Django Code of Conduct
* Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0
* Contributor Covenant
* Geek Feminism Code of Conduct

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TODO Group: Open Code of Conduct" in combination with "self written Code of Conduct", because TODO Group 
provides the most fitting template for this project that doesn't include too much information, yet everything important 
to ensure a good communication. However, some parts of the template can be adjusted and other relevant information can 
be added.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### self written Code of Conduct

* Good, because it's adjustable to the individual needs
* Good, because it's not as overloaded with information as the templates
* Bad, because it's very time-consuming

### TODO Group: Open Code of Conduct

* Good, because it's very comprehensive and covers all relevant aspects of a Code of Conduct
* Good, because it's structured in different sections that make it easier to understand and adjust

### Django Code of Conduct

* Good, because it's reduced to only the essential parts of the Code of Conduct
* Bad, because it only covers the DOs

### Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0

* Bad, because it mostly covers Leadership and authority, which is not as relevant for this project

### Contributor Covenant

* Good, because it's an established template that's used by many organisations
* Bad, because it focuses a lot on the Enforcement and Enforcement Guidelines, which is not as relevant for this
project

### Geek Feminism Code of Conduct

* Good, because it's very inclusive
* Bad, because it only focuses on harassment and covers no other behavioral DOs and DON'Ts
