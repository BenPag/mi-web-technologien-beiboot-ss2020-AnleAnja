# Node.js and Express.js for backend development

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2020-04-02

## Context and Problem Statement

An independent server backend is important to manage and save the images as well as manipulating them.

## Considered Options

* node.js 13.13.0 - server-side platform for implementing network instructions
* express.js - fast and lightweight node.js framework for web applications

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "node.js" in cooperation with "express.js", because these technologies are specified in the concept for the Cranach Timeline project and practicing these technologies is essential.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* practicing technologies that are relevant for other projects
* no explicit training because the technologies are common

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* common technologies are reused instead of trying new technologies
