## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
**mi-web-technologien-beiboot-ss2020-AnleAnja** community as well as steps to reporting unacceptable
behavior. Our goal is to make explicit what we expect from participants in this community as well as its
leaders.

### Diversity Statement

Open Source projects thrive on diverse perspectives. Complex projects require diverse perspectives which
you only get when you invite dissimilar people to participate in the group. When you bring people from
different backgrounds together on complex projects tensions arise, sometimes leading to verbal abuse and
even threats of violence. Establishing a Code of Conduct is one way to signify this project values the
perspectives of many. We are committed to ensuring participants have an effective method of escalating 
reports of misconduct so that we can maintain a productive community for all participants.

### Expected Behaviors

We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of
communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issue, pull request, comment) devoid of vocal tone,
gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is especially important to convey
these attitudes in text. This includes the following behaviors:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being friendly and patient
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Kind to beginners
- Choosing words carefully

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Participants in this open source community remain in good standing when they do not conduct themselves
in a manner that violates this Code of Conduct. Misconduct includes:

- Calling out project members by their identity or background in a deliberately negative or insulting
manner. This includes but is not limited to slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect
classes such as race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion,
sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features,
language, profession, membership of a national minority, mental or physical ability.
- Insulting remarks about a personâ€™s lifestyle practices.
- Threats of violence or intimidation or any project member.
- Unwanted sexual attention or behavior unsuitable for the topic of the open source project.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.

We cannot list all forms of harassment in an exhaustive manner, nor do we seek to declare some forms of
harassment as benign or not worthy of action. Rather, if a project member feels harassed we ask they
report the incident. The incident will be recorded and addressed. Furthermore, we insist that the
victim of this harassment not address the issue in the forum in public, as this tends to intensify the
problem for the parties in question and for the community as a whole.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness misconduct, or have any other concerns about the conduct of members of this
project, please report it by contacting us via [Mail](mailto:anja_katharina.bertels@smail.th-koeln.de).
All reports will be handled with discretion.
